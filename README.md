excel vba homework! 

Website References: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42633273/finding-max-of-a-column-in-vba> referenced the max function in this website to add to my "greatest % increase/decrease" and "greatest volume"

<https://www.excel-pratique.com/en/vba_tricks/last-row> looked this up to find out the last row in a long list. used it to find the last row of column 1 of the main table and column 9 of the summary table. 

I have attached a version of the macro that works on 1 sheet and a macro that works on every sheet. Thanks for your time reading over this!
